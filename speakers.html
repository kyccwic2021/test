                                            <p>I have always had an interest in technology and originally had planned to be in a career related to my bachelorâ€™s Degree. Upon graduation, I joined the Franklin Police Department.  After a few years of working patrol, a position opened in the Franklin Police Departments Investigations Unit. I was assigned to general investigations, and specialized in crimes involving technology, sexual offenses, and crimes against children.  As crimes involving technology became more common, I saw the need for more formal education in the IT field. I attended Bowling Green Technical College (now Southcentral Kentucky Community and Technical College - SKYCTC), a part of the Kentucky Community & Technical College System. I earned an Associates of Applied Science in Computer and Information Technology, specializing in Network Technologies.  I was fortunate enough to be asked to be on the United States Secret Service Electronic Crimes Task Force. They are given advanced training at the National Computer Forensic Institute in Hover, Alabama. My work with the ECTC was one of the highlights of my career.  I was promoted to Captain, Assistant Chief of Police, a few years before my retirement. That ended my days of investigations. Looking back at my career, I know the most import thing I did was help victims, particularly children, get the justice they deserved.  After retirement, I became an adjunct instructor with SKYCTC teaching networking and security related classes. This led into a full-time instructor position with SKYCTC, also becoming the Program Coordinator. These experiences solidified my love and appreciation for SKYCTC as a fantastic place to learn, work, and connect.  While I still volunteer frequently at SKYCTC, I have now transitioned into being the Chief Technology Officer for Millstone Labs and the Security and Compliance Officer for ISTT (Innovative Solutions Through Technology).</p>

                                            <p>My personality thrives when solving problems or exploring, so I solve loan problems to fund my explorations - it's a good life.</p>

When they passed away, I was motivated by this experience to change my career path. I wanted to educate more people on how important it is to make sure they have a financial cushion, incase of any unexpected medical emergencies or tragedies.  This experience also taught me how important it is to make new connections everyday, becauseÂ you never know where life will lead you!Â  I have learned how to utilize LinkedIn for so many different uses and seen how wonderful this platform can be if treated with the correct mentality.</p>
